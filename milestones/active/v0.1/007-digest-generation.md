# Digest Generation -- **IN REFINEMENT**

## WHAT / TO WHOM / WHY

**WHAT**: The final synthesis step that takes ranked, clustered content and produces a structured daily digest organized by topic cluster, with three parallel lanes per cluster: Builders, Security, and Business. This is the product — the thing the user actually reads.

**TO WHOM**: The user, who wants to open one digest and walk away feeling caught up on AI developments that matter to them, with clear links to dig deeper on anything that grabs their attention.

**WHY**: Raw ranked items are still just a list. The digest adds editorial structure — it groups related developments, summarizes what each lane is saying about the same topic, and highlights where perspectives diverge. This is the difference between "here are 20 links" and "here's what's happening in AI today, organized by what you care about."

## Requirements

### Structure
- The digest is organized by **topic cluster**, not by source or lane
- Each topic cluster section includes:
  - **Cluster headline**: A short, descriptive title for the storyline (e.g., "Agents in Production Hit Scaling Walls")
  - **Builders lane summary**: What shipped, what broke, who's experimenting — in 2-4 sentences with links
  - **Security lane summary**: What the risks are, what failed, what to watch — in 2-4 sentences with links
  - **Business lane summary**: Who deployed what, ROI signals, operating models — in 2-4 sentences with links
  - **Deep dive links**: 2-5 links to source material for readers who want to go deeper on this cluster
- Not every cluster needs all three lanes. If a cluster has no security-relevant items, omit the Security lane for that cluster.

### Synthesis
- Lane summaries are generated by an LLM from the selected items' content and metadata
- Summaries should synthesize across items, not just concatenate individual summaries
- Where lanes disagree or offer different perspectives on the same topic, highlight the tension (this is the gold)
- Summaries use plain language appropriate for a strategist, not a researcher

### Formatting
- The digest has a clear visual hierarchy: date → cluster → lanes → links
- Each item link includes source attribution (e.g., "[Latent Space]", "[HN]", "[McKinsey]")
- The digest includes a brief "top 3" section at the top for readers who only have 2 minutes

### Consistency
- The digest follows the same structure every day so the user builds a reading habit
- Cluster ordering: most important/highest-scoring clusters first

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Digest is organized by topic cluster with lane summaries and deep dive links
- [ ] Lane summaries synthesize across items (not just repeat individual summaries)
- [ ] Clusters without relevant items for a lane omit that lane gracefully
- [ ] All links point to the original source content and include source attribution
- [ ] A "top 3" section appears at the top of every digest
- [ ] Digest structure is consistent across daily runs
- [ ] Digest is readable and useful in under 10 minutes
